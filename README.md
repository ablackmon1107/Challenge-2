# Portfolio
My motivation for this project was to produce a portfolio that I can use after the bootcamp is finished. 
I built this project so that all of my projects can be easily accessed in one place for my future employers. 
This project will help me to show potential employers my real life examples of my coding skills,
rather than just a certificate that says I completed this course. 
During this project, I learned how to create a webpage and use CSS to make it look better and more appealing. 
I was able to strengthen my understanding of the CSS Box Model and Flexbox, which I'm sure I will use alot in the future. 
My project stands out because I added elements to my CSS stylesheet that are representative of me and what I can bring to the technology field, specifically coding.
Features include a navigation bar to easily access the different sections, and a sign up form to get email updates on my portfolio, 
and pictured links to all of my current projects.
